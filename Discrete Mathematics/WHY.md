I really don’t get why an instructor creates **a thousand slides** for something trivial that even my 8-year-old brother could nail in half an hour, then drags it out for two hours per lecture, two lectures a week (four hours total). When you actually sit down to study and summarize, it’s more like **five slides** max.

Am I secretly Carl Gauss or Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, or do they just totally suck at teaching?

Oh, and btw the same instructor in MATH 105 – Probability and Statistics, I did this Monty Hall project and the instructor literally didn’t understand it. I had to stay for 20 minutes explaining the whole thing, only for him to ask me:

* “So, will the contestant win or not?”
* “How many times will they win?”

Bro, I’m proving a theory—why are we talking about numbers?

We gave him the **worst ratings** possible in the history of surveys for a math instructor, and they STILL let him teach Discrete Math for CS majors. The only excuse the GPA slaves who love him give is: "His leniency in grades and his tolerance of the difficulty level of exams for any course he teaches gives us the highest rating." Yeah right, rating. What are we now, Uber cabs? I’ve heard he even lets TAs write the quizzes. I’m so done with this place.

Feel free to roast this rant all you want because I DON'T care.

Anyways,
